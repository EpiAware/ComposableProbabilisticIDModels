## Talk plan

- Background
- Proposed requirements
- Our approach
- Case studies
- Wrap up

## TL;DR

- Modelling evidence must be timely, rigorous, and
  collaborative but current approaches force a trade-off
- Chaining models offers flexibility but loses information
  and introduces bias; joint models are rigorous but
  monolithic and not reusable
- Composable models can be developed and validated as parts
  then composed for joint analysis, supporting a rigorous
  modelling workflow
- We demonstrate a proof of concept in Julia/R, replicating
  three published analyses by composing shared and novel
  components
- Work remains but investment in adaptable modelling
  infrastructure that can incorporate diverse data to
  provide timely evidence for policy is critical

# Background

## The gap

## Analysing data separately

## Analysing all data together

## The Rt estimation ecosystem

## Rt estimation research

## The Bayesian workflow

## How composability might help

# Proposed requirements

## Requirements for a composable framework

# Our approach {subtitle="A front-end DSL for epidemiology with a back-end probabilistic programming language"}

## Our approach

- Domain-specific language for epidemiology
- Modelling backend

## Domain-specific language

## Composable components

## Turing.jl as a modelling backend

# Case studies

## Autoregressive example
