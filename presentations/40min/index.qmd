## Talk plan

- Background
- Proposed requirements
- Proof of concept
- Case studies
- Wrap up

## TL;DR

- Modelling evidence must be timely, rigorous, and
  collaborative but current approaches force a trade-off
- Chaining models offers flexibility but loses information
  and introduces bias; joint models are rigorous but
  monolithic and often not reusable
- Composable models can be developed and validated as parts
  then composed for joint analysis, supporting a rigorous
  modelling workflow
- We demonstrate a proof of concept in Julia/R, replicating
  three published analyses by composing shared and novel
  components
- Work remains but investment in adaptable modelling
  infrastructure that can incorporate diverse data to
  provide timely evidence for policy is critical
