## Talk plan

- Background
- Proposed requirements
- Proof of concept
- Case studies
- Wrap up

## TL;DR

- Outbreak models need to be fast, accurate, and built
  collaboratively but current approaches force a trade-off
- You can chain simple models together (flexible but loses
  information) or build one big custom model (rigorous but
  not reusable)
- We propose a middle ground: modular building blocks that
  snap together and can be reused across projects
- We built a proof of concept in Julia/R and showed it can
  replicate published COVID-19 and influenza analyses by
  mixing and matching components
- The approach makes it easier for different experts to
  contribute pieces and could work well with AI coding
